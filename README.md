# Config Installer

Small(ish) project to migrate a scipt I have been using to create directories and symlink various dotfiles and configuration directories into the locations that they are expected to be.

## TODO

- Add flags to executable to account for providing source and target directories
- Add ability to save config to a file which can be parsed on future executions
- Add dependency management
- Add interactive mode
